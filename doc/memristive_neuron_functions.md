# Memristive neuron functions

  1. Bio-compatible integration of excitatory and inhibitory inbound pulses.
  1. Bio-plausible leakage period of the membrane potential 5ms.
  1. Bio-plausible refractory period when neuron is unable to generate outbound spikes 5-7ms.
  1. Bio-compatible threshold that triggers the generation of outbound spike only after several inbound excitatory spikes (-55mV).
  1. Bio-compatible learning functions matching eSTDP and iSTDP of biological neurons.
  1. Bio-compatible neuromodulation of learning functions.
